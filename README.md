# McMaster MECHENG ME754 - Battery State of Charge Estimation

This repository contains teaching materials and project resources for the McMaster MECHENG ME754 course guest lecture on using transformers for battery state of charge estimation.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the application of transformer models to estimate the state of charge (SoC) of batteries. The SoC is a critical parameter in the operation of battery-powered systems, as it indicates the remaining charge in a battery relative to its capacity.

## Contents

- **Lectures**: Slide decks and notes from the guest lecture.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Tutorials and example code demonstrating the use of transformers for SoC estimation.
- **Python Scripts**: Supplementary scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the project.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ahmedsalahacc/mcmaster-mecheng-me754.git
cd mcmaster-mecheng-me754
```

## Usage

Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the implementation of transformer models for SoC estimation. You can run the notebooks locally or in a cloud-based environment such as Google Colab.
